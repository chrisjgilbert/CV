## About

I am a former Sound Designer who decided to learn to code at Makers Academy. Having designed and created sounds for the TV and radio, I now want to help design and create applications for the Web.

Ideally, I am looking to work at a company in the media industry - preferably film, music or sport.

## Skills

### Technical

My previous role required me to learn new technical skills quickly. My ability to do this meant whilst I was at McCann Erickson I was trusted by the Senior Engineer to run several high pressured sessions despite only being an Assistant at the time.

The job necessitated being a speedy user of audio software, having an in depth knowledge of audio, and being comfortable interpreting often complex audio specifications and applying them to your work.

This has set me in good stead to be able to pick up new technologies quickly. In the 12 weeks at Makers I have built projects using:

* Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, RSpec, Capybara
* JS, Express, Node, React, EJS, MongoDB, Zombie, Jasmine, Chai/Mocha
* Python, Django, Pytest
* Travis, Heroku
* APIs & SDKs such as Aylien, Spotify, IBM Watson, Openweather, The Guardian

### Creative

I developed my creative problem solving skills in my role as a Sound Designer because a client would typically come to you with audio 'that just isn't working', or is noisy, and it would be your job to analyse it and come up with a solution to fix it.

Creative problem solving has therefore been an invaluable skill to transfer to development, which necessitates it and I feel I have developed it further whilst at Makers - solving some difficult challenges.

* I won a 2016 Silver LIA award for an Xbox Radio commercial.
* I was the guitarist and co-songwriter in a signed band between 2010-2013 which included releasing a full length album on Naim Edge and playing at Reading & Leeds festival.

### Communication

Throughout my career I have acted as a translator between the technical and non-technical. Describing sound can be hard, and my ability to interpret non-technically described client briefs into the what they required technically was a large part of my role.

Whilst following Agile processes and XP values at Makers it has been important to have very strong communication skills and I have particularly enjoyed the pairing and team projects and my communication skills have been enhanced further.
