## About

I am a former Sound Designer who decided to learn to code at Makers Academy. Having designed and created sounds for the TV and radio, I now want to help design and create applications for the Web. Ideally, I am looking to work at a company that distributes media - preferably film, music or sport.

### Technical

My previous role required me to learn new technical skills quickly. My ability to do this meant whilst I was at McCann Erickson I was trusted by the Senior Engineer to run several high pressured sessions despite only being an Assistant at the time.

The job's technical skills involved being a professional and fast user of audio software, knowledge of acoustics and microphones, and an being comfortable interpreting often complex audio specifications and applying them to your work. I also kept up with and learned newer technologies such as Source Connect and the world of VR audio.

- Professional Pro Tools, Logic, Native Instruments and Oxford Plugin user.
- I achieved Wwise 101 certification through self-learning.

### Creative

I used my creative skills in my role as a Sound Designer because a client would typically come to you with audio 'that just isn't working', or is noisy, and it would be your job to analyse it and come up with a solution to fix it.

I am at my happiest when creating and music has been a major part of my life. I was the guitarist and co-songwriter in a signed band between 2010-2013 which included releasing a full length album on Naim Edge and playing at Reading & Leeds festival.

- I won a 2016 Silver LIA award for an Xbox Radio commercial.
- I contributed bumper sounds to the worlds most popular Sound Design podcast, Tonebenders, which are still used today!

### Communication

Throughout my career I have acted as a translator between the technical and non-technical. Describing sound can be hard, and my ability to interpret non-technically described client briefs into the what they required technically was a large part of my role.

Likewise, a client could become frustrated when their vision wasn't materialising due to a technical reason. I would then have to explain why this problem was occurring in a non-technical way in order for a client to grasp it.

It is something that I particularly enjoy and since learning to code i've begun a blog communicating my experiences thus far.
