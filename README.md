## Chris Gilbert

I am a former Sound Designer who has decided to learn to code at Makers Academy. Having designed and created sounds for the TV and radio, I now want to design and create applications for the Web. Ideally, I am looking to work at a company that distributes media - be it film, music or sport.

## Skills

#### Technical

A Sound Designer's job is primarily a technical one.

It is also one where the skills are typically learnt 'on the job'. My ability to learn new technical skills quickly meant whilst I was at McCann Erickson I was trusted by the Senior Engineer to run several high pressured sessions, despite only being an Assistant at the time.

The job's technical skills involved being a professional user of audio software, an ability to mix audio using plugins, knowledge of acoustics and microphones, an ability to understand audio specifications, and keep up to date with new technologies such as Source Connect (like Skype for audio studios).

- Professional Pro Tools, Logic, Native Instruments and Oxford Plugin user.
- I achieved Wwise 101 certification through self-learning.
- Ability to mix to various specifications including R128, OP59, 82LEQ, etc.

#### Creative

I'm at my happiest when creating things or using my creative skills to problem solve.

I used my creative skills in my role as a Sound Designer because a client would typically come to you with a problem - noisy audio for example - and it would be your job to find a solution to fixing it. Furthermore, a client might have a certain bit of audio 'that just isn't working' and it would be your job to analyse what that could mean and then come up with a way of fixing it.

Music has also been a major part of my life and I love the creative process of writing and producing it.

I was the guitarist and co-songwriter in a signed band between 2010-2013 which included releasing a full length album on Naim Edge and playing at Reading & Leeds festival (there is a YouTube video somewhere..!). I still produce electronic music when time allows.

- I won a 2016 Silver LIA award for an Xbox Radio commercial.
- I contributed bumper sounds to the worlds most popular Sound Design podcast, Tonebenders, which are still used today!

#### Communication

Throughout my career I have acted as a translator between the technical and non-technical. Describing sound can be hard, and my ability to translate non-technically described client briefs into the technical, and deliver them, was a large part of my role.

Furthermore, translating technical language into non-technical is something I am comfortable with. For example, I would have to explain why something technical is occurring in a non-technical way in order for a client to understand it.

It is something that I particularly enjoy and since learning to code i've begun a blog detailing my experiences thus far.
